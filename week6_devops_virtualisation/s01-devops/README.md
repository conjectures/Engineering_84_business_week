# Development Environment Provisioning

### Why do we need devops

## IT before devops
- Software dev team
- Wall team
- Quality assurance team
- System engineering team

### Infrastructure revolution
On premise vs cloud( 9 to 68% )
having infrastructure on premises needs fixes, patches, upgrades, maintenance and it is not easily scalable.
On the other hand, cloud computing allows all of the above, just for a subscription fee. Or by paying as much as used.

### Application Design Patterns
Monolith vs Microservices

### Software Development Methodology
- Waterfall (sequential, hard to backtrack and fix issues)
- Agile (iterative, easier to fix bugs)

### Challenges in IT
Challenges in new SDLC (four pillars of devops)
- Ease of use
- Flexibility
- Robustness
- Cost


### What is devops
- Collaboration of development and operations
- A culture which promotes collaboration between Development and operations teams to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way
- A practice of development and operation engineers taking part together in the whole service lifecycle
- An approach throught which superior quality software can be developed quickly with more reliability

### CAMS model
The CAMS model, first described by Damon Edwards and John Willis, is trying to answer what DevOps is.
CAMS stands for Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing, which are described below:

- Culture

The DevOps Culture refers to a set of practices that are commonly found in different organisations.
Devops culture includes the use of Agile methodology, the willness to limit the level of technical debt, among others.
Technical debt is the implied work that will be required to refactor an easy and quick solution that is implemented now, instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
It is important to study and understand the reason why organisations choose certain practices, rather than replicating them blindly; there is a wide range of practices, and they can all be tailored for a specific use case.
Therefore, knowing about them and how they work is an important part of determining which values will work for your organisation

- Automation

Automation, while very important in the work of a DevOps engineer, only amounts to a quarter of their work. 

However, by automating processes, the flow of information becomes a lot faster, which in turn speeds up the software development cycle and ultimately helps bring software to the client sooner.
In fact, if a problem or bug occurs, it will be detected much sooner when automated systems are in place, which also means that the code quality is improved.

Automation also refers to infrastructure as code, where servers, code, development and production environments are set up and tested continuously, without the need for human interaction.

- Measurement

It is very important for DevOps to be continuously imporving. To achive this we need to measure statistics, for example the response time of the system, so that we know what can be further improved.

- Sharing

The last component of the CAMS model is Sharing.
This is to demonstrate the importance of transparency, visibility and the transfering of knowledge that is required to occur between the teams that the DevOps engineer attempts to link.

## DevOps Principles
- Customer centric action
- End-to-end responcibility
- Continuous Improvement
- Continuous Deployment
- Continuous Monitoring

## Tasks of devops engineers

- Knowledge of codign goes a long away
- Soft skills
- Understanding automation
- Security
