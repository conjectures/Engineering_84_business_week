# Strings and Casting

`greetings = Hello World!`

Indexing in Python starts from 0
```python
# H e l l o   W o r l  d  !
# 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

```
Reverse indexing starts from `-1`
```python
print(greetings[-6:])
# World!
```

# Let's have a look at some string methods

```python 
print(greetings.upper())
# HELLO WORLD!
print(greetings.lower())
# hello world!
print(greetings.capitalize())
# Hello World!
print(greetings.replace("World", "Cosmos"))
# Hello Cosmos!
```
