# Subject 02 - User Input
> Time: 20'

In Python, we can get user input with the keyword `input`. When called, the terminal will wait for the user to input text, until the *Enter* key is pressed.
`input` needs to be called with parenthesies attached:
```python
value = input()
```

If needed, a short text message can be added to the `input` call that will convey information to the user before asking for input
```python
name = input('Please write your name: ')
```
