# Python: Object Oriented Programming

## What is OOP
Object Oriented Programming is one of the most widely used programming paradigms.
As the name implies, OOP works with objects.
In python these are also refered to as classes, and they are used to bind data or functionality in a simple structure.

## Four pillars
Object Oriented Programming is based on four core principles, also known as pillars of OOP: **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism**.

**Encapsulation** is achieved when a class has an internal, *private* state, which is maintained by its own internal functions.
The user doesn't impact the class state directly, but can access it via the public functions, or methods that the class provides.
Encapsulation is a core pillar of OOP as it more generally models the way objects behave in real life.
To demonstrate this, consider a dog that has internal "private attributes" such as hunger, sleepiness and thirst.
The owner of the dog can't really control these attributes; instead he can perform certain functions to impact them indirectly. 
Specifically, the owner can fill the dog's bowl with food and water and provide a bed for his pet.

**Abstraction** is an extension of encapsulation, which aims to simplify the usage of the classes by exposing only a high-level mechanism of using it.
That is, the class is developed in a way that the implementation details are hidden and only the relevant operations should be exposed to the user.
Most electronic appliances apply this concept in real life. A fridge or a lamp have very different purposes but they both require electricity to start working.
The user knows how to plug in the lamp and fridge to the mains electricity but he doesn't need to know how a heat pump works, or how LEDs use electroluminescence to shine.

**Inheritance** is very useful when there are similar objects that share common functionality but are not entirely the same.
With inheritance, a class can pass down functionality to *children* classes, where the same code can be reused without rewriting the same methods.
These children classes can then add more specific functionality and pass those down to other children, thus, forming a hierarcy of *parent* and *child* classes.
A typical hierarchy example is animals - mammmals - dogs.
