# Ansible

## Benefits
### Simple
It uses `yaml`,
### Agentless
That is, when you create a controller, it contains the Ansible controller, but it does not require any configuration tool installation on the nodes it controls.
### Secure
It uses `ssh` to connect to other servers.
### Efficient SDLC
Integrates with other tools, 
We can change provider very easily.
