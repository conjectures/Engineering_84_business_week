## Interview preparation

1. **What is DevOps and what is the benefit of using it?**

DevOps is a combination of Development and Operations. 

In the past, the two teams were working in isolation, and a lot of time was wasted since the cooperation between them was not synergistic. The developers work to push new versions as soon as possible, while the Operations goal is to keep the project stable. Therefore, the goals of the two teams are naturally at odds with one another. 

With DevOps, the notion of combining the two goals is more achievable. DevOps embraces the fast paced development of the programming team while keeping the stability of that is required, with the use of automated tools, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code and many other tools.
In this fashion, time, money and effort is no longer wasted by trying to integrate the two groups.

2. **Why choose Sparta Global?**
I have had a short introduction to DevOps, and in this short experience I have found that I enjoy it very much as a profession. 
When a recruiter from Sparta Global has approached me, I was very fond of the idea that their trainees receive expert education from world class professional in their fields. I was also very fond of the fact that the recruiter was very friendly, approachable and has shown genuine interest in our talks.
However, I could have chosen any educational institude or resource online to learn more about this role. What really made Sparta Global different is the sense of community between the trainees, the prospect of meeting new people, making connections and expanding my network.
I am really impressed with the way that Sparta Global treats its current and past graduates and am very excited to be included in this community.

3. **What is Agile and what is the benefit of implementing it?**
Agile is a methodology, or a set of values and principles, that adapts the software development cycle for modern development of (digital) products.
It is inspired by the Agile manifesto
It mainly focuses on adaptability, inclusivity of the client, iterative growth and improvement, communication, along with many more practices that help teams achieve their end goal of completing a product.
The Agile methodology is adopted more and more, as it has proven a recipe for success for countless projects.

4. **What is SCRUM and what is the benefit of implementing it?**
SCRUM is a term borrowed from rugby, where a team would join together and talk about their strategy. In the same way, SCRUM is a methodology,
usually used in conjunction with Agile, that improves the communication between team members, irons out any problems that are in the way and fortifies collaborative effort by bringing the team closer together.
Teams that adopt SCRUM, benefit greatly by doing so, as it helps all members keep up, stay in the same page, avoid misunderstandings and help each other.

5. **Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years**
Ideally, I would like to 'rise throught the ranks', demonstrate my skills and attain the title of **Senior DevOps Engineer**. I would like to get a couple of certifications, including AWS, CKA among others. 
Then I would like to specialise in the field of Security. I have dabbled a bit wiht white hat hacking and I find the interaction between DevOps and Cyber Security to be fascinating. My ideal job would be to work with a small to medium sized company, where I can have more impact and more opportunities to show the quality of my work.
