# Let's see the data types in action
a = 24  # int
b = 16  # int
c = 5.5  # float

# Arithmetic operators
# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)

# Comparison operators
# print(a > b)
# print(a < b)

# Let's look at some built in methods related with booleans

# isalpha() method helps us find non alphanumeric characters in strings:
print(greetings.isalpha())
# for example:
greetings2 = 'HelloWorld2'
print(greetings2.isalpha())
# We could also check if it is lowercase
print(greetings.islower())
print(greetings2.endswith('2'))
print(greetings.endswith('H'))
