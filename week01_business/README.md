## What is DevOps and what is the benefit of using it?

DevOps is a combination of Development and Operations. 

In the past, the two teams were working in isolation, and a lot of time was wasted since the cooperation between them was not synergistic. The developers work to push new versions as soon as possible, while the Operations goal is to keep the project stable.
Therefore, the goals of the two teams are naturally at odds with one another. 

With DevOps, the notion of combining the two goals is more achievable. DevOps embraces the fast paced development of the programming team while keeping the stability of that is required, with the use of automated tools, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code and many other tools.
In this fashion, time, money and effort is no longer wasted by trying to integrate the two groups.

## Why choose Sparta Global?

I have had a short introduction to DevOps, and in this short experience I have found that I enjoy it very much as a profession. 
When a recruiter from Sparta Global has approached me, I was very fond of the idea that their trainees receive expert education from world class professional in their fields. I was also very fond of the fact that the recruiter was very friendly, approachable and has shown genuine interest in our talks.
However, I could have chosen any educational institude or resource online to learn more about this role. What really made Sparta Global different is the sense of community between the trainees, the prospect of meeting new people, making connections and expanding my network.
I am really impressed with the way that Sparta Global treats its current and past graduates and am very excited to be included in this community.

## What is Agile and what is the benefit of implementing it?

Agile is a **methodology**, or a set of values and principles, that adapts the software development cycle for modern development of (digital) products.
It is inspired by the Agile manifesto.
It mainly focuses on adaptability, inclusivity of the client, iterative growth and improvement, communication, along with many more practices that help teams achieve their end goal of completing a product.
The Agile methodology is adopted more and more, as it has proven a recipe for success for countless projects.

## What is SCRUM and what is the benefit of implementing it?

SCRUM is a term borrowed from rugby, where a team would join together and talk about their strategy. 
In fact, SCRUM is a manifestation of the agile methodology. It is a **framework** that can be used to help teams developing complex products.
This is achieved by breaking tasks down into small goals that can be completed in time boxed iterations. 
The scrum framework defines the *Scrum Events* in order to facilitate teamwork and communication.

Teams that adopt SCRUM, benefit greatly by doing so, as it helps all members keep up, stay in the same page, avoid misunderstandings and help each other.

## What are the 5 Scrum Events
The five events of Scrum are:
- **Sprint Planning**:
  The event that kick starts each Sprint. This is where the Product Owner and Developers discuss which Product Backlog Items (PBI) will be included in the sprint. 
  The Product Owner has a say in the PBI will be included in the Sprint along with the Developers. The Developers asserss the PBI and estimate how many items will be delivered by the end of the Sprint.
- **Daily scrum**:
  Timeboxed 15 minute meeting where the Developers find the opportunity to check-in, assess progress and review or plan their activities for the next 24 hours

- **Sprint Review**:
  The sprint review is done at the end of the sprint and is mainly used to show the Done Increment to stakeholders (customers, managemend and any other interested party). 
  During the review, the working features are inspected and any useful feedback is incorporated in the backlog.

- **Sprint Retrospective**:
  Also performed at the end of the sprint, it is when the Scrum Team revies what could be improved for future Sprints, and how they should do it.
  It is a testament of the notion that, no matter how well the team performs, they are always subject to improvement.
  The Sprint Retrospective is a collaborative effort, and the whole Scrum Team should participate (Developers, Scrum Master and Product Owner)

- **The Sprint**:
  Contains all the work and all other events that happen during the timeboxed period of development.

## Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years

Ideally, I would like to 'rise throught the ranks', demonstrate my skills and attain the title of **Senior DevOps Engineer**. I would like to get a couple of certifications, including AWS, CKA among others. 
Then I would like to specialise in the field of Security. I have dabbled a bit wiht white hat hacking and I find the interaction between DevOps and Cyber Security to be fascinating. 
My ideal job would be to work with a small to medium sized company, where I can have more impact and more opportunities to show the quality of my work.
